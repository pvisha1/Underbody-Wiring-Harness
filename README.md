🚗 Underbody Wiring Harness – CATIA V5 Project

This project showcases the complete 3D routing, packaging, and flattening of an Automotive Underbody Wiring Harness using CATIA V5 Electrical Workbench.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate OEM-level harness routing practices, packaging constraints, clip positioning, and manufacturable bundle creation.
